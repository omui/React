everthing that changed in application including the data and UI state is contained in single state or object we call it state.

the state is minimal representation of the data in your app, 

state is read only

the only way to change the state tree is by dispatching an action.

an action is plain javascript object describing the change

the action is mininal representation of the change to the data.

pure function are the function who's return value depend on the solely values of the arguments.

pure function do not modify the value passed to them.

To describe state mutation you have to write a pure function that takes the previous states of the app, the action is being dipsatched and returns next state of the app. this function is called reducers
